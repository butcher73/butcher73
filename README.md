## Hey there! 👋

![](https://hit.yhype.me/github/profile?user_id=107277499)

I’m **The Butcher**—not in the mob kind of way, but more in the BBQ and coding kind of way. 🥩 By day, I’m a coder working with **Python**, **TypeScript**, and **Solidity**. By night (or anytime I need a break from the screen), I’m all about grilling up a mean BBQ and planning my next travel adventure.

### A Bit About Me
- 🌐 Deep into **Web3** and **blockchain**—think of it as coding’s spicy side.
- 🔧 Currently learning **Rust** because, hey, why not add more fuel to the coding fire?
- 🍖 On a personal mission to achieve BBQ perfection (if you know the secret, spill it!).

### My Tech Toolbox 🛠️
- **Languages**: Python, TypeScript, Solidity (and trying to tame Rust)
- **Interests**: Blockchain, Smart Contracts, and anything that makes coding more fun.

### Let’s Chat!
- 📬 Hit me up for collabs, BBQ recipes, or just to swap travel stories and coding rants!
